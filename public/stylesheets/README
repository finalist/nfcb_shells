#Stylesheets for the application.

Note that there are scss and css versions of main and print.
- scss is automatically compiled to css and used in render due to the Play! SASS module.
- css is manually compiled (you can use the script compile_stylesheets located in the project directory) because the PDF
module does not work together with the SASS module.
